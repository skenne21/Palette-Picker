## Description

This 5 day Project allows users to generate plattes of random colors, if the user decideds that they want to save the platte, they can add the palette to a project and save it for next time, this project was built to mimic some of the same behavior from this site (https://coolors.co/f79256-fbd1a2-7dcfb6-00b2ca-1d4e89). It was used as a project to build familiarity with building a backend database with Express, node.js and postgress with knex. This project tested the backend server using Mocha and Chai.

## Learning Goals

* Build a backend database using Express, knex, and PostgreSQL.
* Server-side testing should be done using mocha, chai, and chai-http.
* Build a schema with one to many realtionship (project can have many palettes).
* Front-end built using Jquery
* API endpoints for createing new palettes and projects, update palettes and projects and remove projects and palettes.
* Depolying applications to heroku
